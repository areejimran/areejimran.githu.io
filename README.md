> ### A current sophomore at Loyola University Chicago studying Software Engineering with career interests in Data Analysts and Software Development. 


#### I was born in the Netherlands and raised in Chicago, IL. The acceleration and rise of data and technology through out my childhood has encouraged me to be apart of these great innovations that continue to happen on a day to day basis. 

* #### The leadership roles I currently hold on campus: 
  * Minorities In Tech (_Marketing Director_)
  * Software and Systems Laboratory (_Research Assistant_)
  * GirlForward (_Tutor_)

  I strive to gain experience, expand my network to best determine where I fit best in my interests and become involved in community based work. 

  Software Engineering stood out substantially as I enjoy creating, assembling and the marketing aspect of this branch of computer science.  

  It may be challenging but there is an unexplainable adrenaline rush when you debugging your program.
  
  There is a lot of flexibility in how you can apply your major to the different career paths which I admire because there are a lot of opportunities.
